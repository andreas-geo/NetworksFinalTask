# Networks 2 Class Final Project

## Hellenic Mediterranean University - ECE Department

Welcome to our final project for the Networks 2 class at Hellenic Mediterranean University, a comprehensive exploration into advanced networking concepts, implemented and demonstrated through this codebase.
The contributing parties are Andreas Georgitsis and Haris Papadakis

### Project Overview

This project aims to showcase our understanding and application of advanced networking theories and practices. We've designed and developed a network system that addresses specific challenges and demonstrates key principles taught in our Networks 2 class.

### Features

- **Advanced Routing Algorithms:** Implementation of state-of-the-art routing protocols to ensure efficient data transmission across the network.
- **Simulation of Network Congestion:** A detailed simulation environment to analyze network behavior under various stress scenarios and congestion management techniques.
- **User-friendly Interface:** For monitoring network performance metrics in real-time, facilitating easy analysis and decision-making.

### Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: Python
- Networking Tools: Wireshark, Snort
